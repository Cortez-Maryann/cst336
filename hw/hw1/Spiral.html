            The spiral model is favored for large, expensive, and complicated projects. This model uses many of the <br />
            same phases as the waterfall model, in essentially the same order, separated by planning, risk assessment,<br />
            and the building of prototypes and simulations. It is used in the large applications and systems which<br />
            built-in small phases or segments.
