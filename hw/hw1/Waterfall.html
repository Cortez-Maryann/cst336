            The Waterfall Model is a process seen as flowing steadily downwards through the phases of software<br />
            implementation. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous <br />
            phase is complete. The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase<br />
            to handle changes in requirement. The waterfall approach is the earliest approach and most widely<br />
            known that was used for software development. The waterfall approach is the earliest approach and most<br />
            widely known that was used for software development. This Model is great for projects not focusing on<br />
            changing requirements, for example, projects initiated from a request for proposals.
